Create an ATM class based on the class diagram below. For the purposes of testing assume the ATM will recognise only three cards with PIN numbers 1234, 5678 and 9101. A customer is allowed to withdraw up to Â£200 and may only withdraw if a correct PIN number is entered. Write code to simulate an ATM machine.
