Challenges:
1. A furniture removal company has two sizes of vans: small vans for up to 30 items, large vans for more than 30 items. Design a program to input the customer name and the number of items to be moved. The program should display the customer’s name along with the message LARGE VAN or SMALL VAN as required.

2. Write a program that allows the user to enter his/her bank balance and the amount of a withdrawal. If the amount to be withdrawn is less than or equal to the balance, the program should display the new balance. Otherwise, it should display a message saying “Withdrawal not allowed – you will be overdrawn”
